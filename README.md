Cloud storage is widely used in various industries, but concerns about data security 
persist. Traditional techniques like cryptography and steganography have limitations and cannot 
provide sufficient security on their own. To address this issue, we propose a unique security 
system that combines multiple cryptographic algorithms and steganography. By using fast and 
secure symmetric key algorithms, such as AES and DES, along with the benefits of the 
asymmetric key algorithm RSA, we develop an efficient method to encrypt and decrypt data. 
This approach takes advantage of the strengths of each algorithm to create a strong encryption
system that protects data from unauthorized access. 
Furthermore, incorporating splitting and merging techniques adds an extra layer of 
security. The LSB steganography technique is used to securely store essential key information. 
Implementing this comprehensive approach in the cloud environment not only enhances server 
security but also builds user confidence, as encrypted data is stored on a single cloud server. 
Overall, this sophisticated security mechanism offers enhanced data protection, making cloud 
storage a more reliable and secure option for various applications in different industries.
